TODO list of gromosXX
=====================

Release 0.0.2

	ok	change OutGTrajectory: gather chargegroups on first atom, not on cog
	-	write check_state methods for Simulation, Topology and System (and maybe others)
	ok	autoconf flag to create production code
	ok	energy calculation
	-	energy trajectory
	-	excluded atoms reaction field contribution

-------------

Release 0.0.3

	-	gather chargegroups during simulation
	-	handle the GENBOX block
	-	perturbation
	-	check the triclinic computational box

-------------

	-	atomic virial
	-	center of mass motion removal (constraining)
	


	-	P3M, PME
	-	path integral
	-	SD, (MC?)
	-	special forces
	-	perturbation & Tim / Bekker algorithm:
		no perturbed atom in bins => 1. normal, 2. perturbed &
		bins, 3. perturbed & perturbed

	-	rotating the box w/o rotating coordinates is NOT OK.
		translation ok, splitting by lattice vectors ok.
		look into lattice reduction...
