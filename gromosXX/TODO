TODO list of gromosXX
=====================

Release 0.0.2

	ok	change OutGTrajectory: gather chargegroups on first atom, not on cog
	ok	write check_state methods for Simulation, Topology and System (and maybe others)
	ok	autoconf flag to create production code
	ok	energy calculation
	ok	energy trajectory
	ok	excluded atoms reaction field contribution
	ok	check kinetic energy at printout

-------------

Release 0.0.3

	ok	check SHAKE for non-gathered bonds
	ok	gather chargegroups during simulation
	-	handle the GENBOX block
	-	read in perturbation topology
		PERTBOND03 : ok
	-	perturbed interactions
		PERTBOND03 : ok
	-	check the triclinic computational box
	-	add checks to the check_state() methods
	ok	energy fluctuations

-------------

	ok	reorganise iterators (and utility classes) -> avoid circular includes, use stl
	-	atomic virial
	-	center of mass motion removal (constraining)
	-	options for different compilers (see blitz)
	

	- 	EM
	-	P3M, PME
	-	path integral
	-	SD, (MC?)
	-	special forces
	-	perturbation & Tim / Bekker algorithm:
		no perturbed atom in bins => 1. normal, 2. perturbed &
		bins, 3. perturbed & perturbed

	-	rotating the box w/o rotating coordinates is NOT OK.
		translation ok, splitting by lattice vectors ok.
		look into lattice reduction...
