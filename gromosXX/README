BOX block
---------

TRICLINICBOX
	1
	xx	xy	xz
	yx	yy	yz
	zx	zy	zz
END

the first number indicates the boundary condition (0=vacuum,
1=triclinic).
the following numbers are the three box vectors.
a rectangular (cubic) box (with edge length of 5 nm) looks like this:
TRICLINICBOX
	1
	5.0	0.0	0.0
	0.0	5.0	0.0
	0.0	0.0	5.0
END

FORCE block
-----------

no distinction between hydrogen containing interactions and non -
hydrogen containing interactions.
BOND and BONDH can take a value of 2 to use the old gromos87 harmonic
bond length interaction term.


-------------
new behaviour
-------------

multiple solvent
----------------

in principle possible to treat multiple solvents.
(input is not yet changed)

truncated octahedron
--------------------

has to be converted to the corresponding triclinic box.
(a gromos++ program to do that exists)

shake
-----

the bond lengths which are shaken are removed from the bond array and
put into a solute constraints array. this makes it easier to have a few
non-shaken bonds.
a solute constraints block should be added to the input or maybe more
options to the shake parameter?
